1.1.1 | 2017-10-12 10:34:50 -0700

  * Fix hostname validation for Corelight device certificates.

1.1 | 2017-09-26 16:02:06 -0400

  * Renaming BroBox to Corelight Sensor:
        - The "brobox" script becomes "corelight-client".
        - "~/.broboxrc" becomes "~/.corelight-client.rc".
        - "~/.brobox" becomes "~/.corelight-client".
        - The configuration option "brobox" becomes "device".
        - The command-line option "--brobox" becomes "--device" (short version remains "-B").
        - The environment variable BROBOX becomes CORELIGHT_DEVICE.

    For now we continue to support the old BroBox-based names and just
    print warnings that they are deprecated. This support will however
    be removed in a future version.

    the client code.
